                <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg mb-4">Shimla (English: /ˈʃɪmlə/; Hindi: [ˈʃɪmla] (About this soundlisten)), 
                also known as Simla, is the capital and the largest city of the Northern Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. 
                In 1864, Shimla was declared as the summer capital of British India. After independence, the city became the
                 capital of Punjab and was later made the capital city of Himachal Pradesh. It is the principal commercial, cultural
                  and educational centre of the state. It was the capital city in exile of British Burma (present-day Myanmar) from
                   1942 to 1945.[10]

                Small hamlets were recorded prior to 1815 when British forces took control of the area. The climatic conditions 
                attracted the British to establish the city in the dense forests of the Himalayas. As the summer capital, Shimla 
                hosted many important political meetings including the Simla Accord of 1914 and the Simla Conference of 1945. After
                 independence, the state of Himachal Pradesh came into being in 1948 as a result of the integration of 28 princely 
                 states. Even after independence, the city remained an important political centre, hosting the Simla Agreement of 1972.
                  After the reorganisation of the state of Himachal Pradesh, the existing Mahasu district was named Shimla.
